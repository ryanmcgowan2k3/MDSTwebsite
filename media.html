                  <p>[Josh: wooo,Feeling good. Feeling good. Body feels
                    good um you know some stuff to clean up.
                    That first half, turned the ball over too
                    many times, but what a what a resilient
                    group. Um so proud of our guys man. They,
                    they battled their tails off. Hardy
                    making a huge play in the game for us.
                    And then uh know those final final
                    couple drives, I feel like we found a
                    groove on the offensive side of the ball.
                    I feel like I was the ball was coming
                    out the my hands the best all year, so
                    that's that's a good thing. Um but again,
                    just got to be smarter with the
                    ball. <br>
          
                    Reporter: Joshua, how how deep did they dig second
                    half?<br>
          
                    Josh: I mean that's they've been playing
                    like that all all season long. They've
                    been working hard together. That's
                    that's a really good team we just played.
                    You know, that's a great offense. Their
                    quarterback's playing an extremely high
                    level. Um, and they got some, some really
                    dang good playmakers. So for our our team
                    to go go out there and do that, you know
                    it took all three phases tonight, and
                    they were a huge part of it. <br>
          
                    Reporter: When you went into halftime, after you left maybe
                    21 points on the field there. What was
                    the mood as you went into that locker room?
                    The mood is we're we were beating
                    ourselves and I was beating us. Um and
                    that's what it came down to. And again,
                    the turnovers in our own side of the
                    field, um no those are never good, but
                    resilient group. We kept our head down,
                    kept working hard and um found a way to
                    win. <br>
          
                    Reporter: With a lot of confidence in the
                    offense on those last few drives. Going
                    for it, it didn't work on the last one,
                    but what did that say to you guys when
                    he gave you that?<br>
          
                    Josh: Yeah, I mean I we got to
                    go get that. It's a lot of trust in
                    coach. You know we get that, we don't have
                    to have the uh theatrics at the end. You're right
                    Um but t-rap making a heck of a
                    play. You know, he's he's been great for
                    us all year long. He's kind of been
                    playing that that rover role. He's
                    sometimes in sometimes out, depending on
                    Mike and Jordan are ready to go. So he's
                    been working hard all all season. He
                    deserves a moment like that and I'm so
                    so proud of him. <br>
          
                    Reporter: What was it like to know
                    before the game that you were in the
                    playoffs?<br>
          
                    Josh: Umm, honestly it was a big relief,
                    You know coach Vrable and the
                    Titans, I'm a fan of those guys. They, they
                    helped, obviously, with us in this
                    situation, um and they helped today. So um,
                    got to thank those guys. <br>
          
                    Reporter: Where you're
                    headed now, how important was it to get
                    Diggs involved in this game and get him
                    on track knowing that the next one is a
                    playoff game?<br>
          
                    Josh: Yeah, I mean again, we we
                    tried not to do anything out the
                    ordinary, just kind of getting back to
                    what we know, what we love. Umm, you know,
                    just still there's there's a couple big
                    plays out there that you know I
                    got to be able to hit on and you know
                    going forward, that's we're going to work
                    on, but it was good to get him going. But
                    all of our guys made plays. Khalil Shakir
                    made some plays today. Dalton Kincaid, obviously,
                    Dawson with the touchdown um. <br>
          
                    Reporter: Did you get the sense when Hardy running down
                    the field, that the game had just flipped
                    and you were maybe maybe you were
                    feeling it the first time all night that,
                    it was your game to win now? <br>
          
                    Josh: Honestly,
                    this this team felt that way the entire
                    time. we didn't blink. We came in
                    at halftime and understood, you know what
                    was going on. We didn't feel
                    like we were playing up to our potential.
                    So this this second half, all three
                    phases, that's that's who we are. That's
                    what we're going to need to be going
                    forward. <br>
          
                    Reporter: Josh, your shirt says AFC East Champs, that's a lot,
                    but for a while, it did not look like
                    that. When did you guys realize that you
                    still could do this?<br>
          
                    Josh: Um six and six. You know, we we knew
                    what was in front of us, had a lot of
                    internal talks, trusted the guys in this
                    locker room. And at the end of the day,
                    this this this is fun, this is cool, I'll
                    never say no to winning a division, but
                    the only thing that it solidifies is a
                    home game.
