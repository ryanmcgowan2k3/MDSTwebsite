        <p>[feeling good feeling good body feels
          good um you know some stuff to clean up
          that first half turn the ball over too
          many times but what a what a resilient
          group um so proud of our guys man they
          they battled their tails off Hardy
          making a huge play in the game for us
          and then uh know those final final
          couple drives I feel like we found a
          groove on the offensive side of the ball
          I feel like I was the ball was coming
          out the my hands the best all year so
          that's that's a good thing um but again
          just got to be smarter with the
          ball how how deep did they dig second
          half sh
          oh I mean that's they've been playing
          like that all all season long they've
          been working hard together um that's
          that's a really good team we just played
          you know that's a great offense their
          quarterback's playing an extremely high
          level um and they got some some really
          dang good Playmakers so for our our team
          to go go out there and do that you know
          it took all three phases tonight and
          they were a huge part of it when you
          went into halftime after you left maybe
          21 points on the field there what was
          the mood as you went into that Locker
          the mood is we're we were beating
          ourselves and I was beating us um and
          that's what it came down to and again
          the turnovers in our own side of the
          field um no those are never good but
          resilient group we kept our head down
          kept working hard and um found a way to
          win showed a lot of confidence in the
          offense on those last few drives going
          for it it didn't work on the last one
          but what did that say to you guys when
          he gave you that yeah I mean I we got to
          go get that um it's a lot of trust in
          coach you know we get that we don't have
          to have the uh theatrics at the end you
          all right um but t-p making a heck of a
          play you know he's he's been great for
          us all year long uh he's kind of been
          playing that that Rover role he's
          sometimes in sometimes out depending on
          Mike and Jordan are ready to go so he's
          been working hard all all season he
          deserves a moment like that and I'm so
          so proud of him would it like to know
          before the game that you were in the
          playoffs um honestly it was a big relief
          um you know coach coach Vel and the
          Titans I'm a fan of those guys they they
          helped obviously with us in this
          situation um and they helped today so um
          got to thank those guys where you're
          headed now how important was it to get
          Diggs involved in this game and get him
          on track knowing that the next one is a
          playoff game yeah I mean again we we
          tried not to do anything out the
          ordinary just kind of getting back to
          what we know what we love um you know
          just still there's there's a couple big
          plays out there that you know I gota I
          got to be able to hit on and you know
          going forward that's we're going to work
          on but it was good to get him going but
          all of our guys made play khil Shakir
          made some plays today DTA conc obviously
          Dawson with the touchdown um you know
          get the sense when Hardy running down
          the field that the game had just flipped
          and you were maybe maybe you were
          feeling it the first time all night that
          it was your game to win now honestly
          this this team felt that way the entire
          time we didn't blink you know we came in
          at halftime and understood you know what
          was going on um you know we didn't feel
          like we were playing up to our potential
          so this this second half all three
          phases that's that's who we are that's
          what we're going to need to be going
          forward says AFC East Champs it's a loot
          but for a while it did not look like
          that when did you guys realize that you
          still could do
          this um six and six you know we we knew
          what was in front of us had a lot of
          internal talks trusted the guys in this
          locker room and um at the end of the day
          this this this is fun this is cool and
          never say no to winning a division but
          the only thing that it solidifies is a
          home game and one more game so uh
          doesn't mean anything if we go out there
          next week and don't do our job so we got
          to we got to find a way to put our best
          forward and go go find Victory next week
          you said you were you were beating them
          in the first half did you have any
          conversations at half time with Shan
          anything no just again just trying to
          play smart football um trying to play
          Team ball you know uh obviously right
          before the half we get stuff you know
          stopped right at the one yard line and
          that's that's one of those situations
          where it's like it's got to be in the
          end zone or it's got to be incomplete or
          out of bounds um you know so I took away
          three from us there I took away three
          from us first drive of the game the
          fourth and two pass um and I'd rather
          honestly take that than throw it out
          throw it out of bounds give somebody a
          chance you know in that situation so
          again pick and choose your battles but
          uh find a way to win what were you
          thinking on the pass that Trent caught
          for the touchdown when they got the play
          I I just don't just please don't fall
          into their hands you know that that's
          kind of how the game was going early on
          um couple bad rolls early but you know
          that's that's a heck of a catch and you
          know former former team that he was on I
          know this this game means a lot to him
          and he he played a big role had a couple
          huge catches for us so I'm proud of him
          mention that I mean rat made a big play
          field made a big play Hardy these are
          guys who came here and in the biggest
          game made huge moments for this team
          what's it say about those guys and about
          this team it says a lot about the depth
          that we have but it it talks a lot about
          the type of character that we have in
          this locker room guys that haven't been
          asked to do a whole lot um and maybe at
          times being frustrated or or not happy
          with you know the role that they have on
          this team but not not complaining not
          getting upset um finding a way to to
          help this team make football you know
          win games and make football plays and
          you saw that tonight I'm I'm so proud of
          those two they've had a lot of up up and
          downs this year um and again arguably
          two of the the biggest plays in the game
          for from those guys so they they worked
          extremely hard and they deserve it what
          was the adment with Gabe out of the game
          how did that change your what you
          intended to do coming in here yeah just
          still tried to trust the guys um you
          know Trent and and hard stepped up and
          um not sure of the full extent of Gabe
          but you know hopefully we can get him
          back um but those guys are going to have
          to step up make some play for us go go
